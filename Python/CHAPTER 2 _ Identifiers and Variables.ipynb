These words have specific purpose, so we can not use these words for declaring variable, function etc.\n","\n","\n","- Those keywords are :\n","```\n","from, import, if, else, elif, try, except, raise, finally, break,\n","pass, continue, await, True, Flase, return, and, or, in, not, for, while,\n","class, None, is, lambda, as, def, nonlocal, assert, del, global, with,\n","async, yield\n","```\n","\n","**<h2>Identifiers</h2>**\n","\n","- An identifier is name given to entities like variable, function, class etc. As it helps to differentiate one from the other.\n","\n","\n","- **Rules for writing identifiers**\n","\n","  - Identifiers can be a mixture of letters(lowercase or uppercase) or digits or an underscore_.\n","  - An Identifier can not begin with a digit. 1santhosh is invalid, however santhosh1 is valid identifier. Keywords can not be used as identifiers.\n","  ```\n","  lambda = 1 # keywords can't be used throws error\n","  ```\n","  - We cannot use special symbols like !, @, #, $, % etc. in our identifier.\n","  ```\n","  @santhosh = 1 # we can't use special characters\n","  ```\n","  - Python is a case-sensitive language. This means, Variable and variable are not the same.\n","\n","**<h2>Variables</h2>**\n","\n","Variables is a named location which is used to store the data.\n","\n","- For Example :\n","  ```\n","  name = \"Santhosh\"\n","  ```\n","- Here we created a variable as name and we stored ```Santhosh``` to it. And we can change it at any time.\n","  ```\n","  name = \"Santhosh\"\n","\n","  name = \"Jagannath\"\n","  ```\n","- Here initially we stored ```Santhosh``` and we replaced with ```Jagannath``` to it.\n","\n","- **<h3>Assaigning Values to Variables</h3>**\n","\n","  - Example 1 : Declare and assign the value. Here we will assign value ```Santhosh``` to ```name``` variable\n","  ```\n","  name = \"Santhosh\"\n","  ```\n","\n","  - Example 2 : Here we can assign multiple values to multiple variable in a single statement.\n","  ```\n","  a,b,c = 10,20,30\n","  ```\n","  - Example 3 : We can assign same value to multiple variables. Below we will be assigning value ```10``` to all three variable (a,b,c).\n","  ```\n","  a=b=c=10\n","  ```\n","\n","- **<h3>Rules and Naming Convention for Variables</h3>**\n","\n","  - Constant and variable names should have a combination of letters(lowercase or uppercase) or digits (0 to 9) or an underscore (_).\n","  - For example:\n","  ```\n","  snake_case\n","  MACRO_CASE\n","  camelCase\n","  CapWords\n","  ```\n","  - Create a name that makes sense. For example, first_name and second_name  makes more sense than name1 and name2. If variable name having two words, use underscore to separate them.\n","  - For example:\n","  ```\n","  my_name\n","  current_salary\n","  ```\n","\n","**<h2>Python Constants</h2>**\n","\n","- Constants is a type of variable whose value can not be changed. Usually Constants are declared using capital letters.\n","- Example 1 : Declare and assign a value.\n","```\n","PI = 3.14\n","```\n","\n","- **<h3>Rules and Naming Convention for constants</h3>**\n","  - For example:\n","  ```\n","  PI\n","  G\n","  MASS\n","  SPEED_OF_LIGHT\n","  TEMP\n","  ```\n","  - Never use special symbols like !, @, #, $, %, etc.\n","  - Don't start a variable name with a digit.\n","\n","\n","**Note**\n","- Identifier is name given to entity like variable, function, class etc. And variable is name given to memory location."],"metadata":{"id":"_jwkGE3KU7Eg"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"lDuOALu0I8Dd"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
