It's commonly used to derive new values or perform calculations based on certain conditions.\n","\n","```\n","CASE\n","    WHEN condition1 THEN result1\n","    WHEN condition2 THEN result2\n","    ...\n","    ELSE default_result\n","END\n","```\n","\n","Here's how the CASE statement works:\n","\n","1. It evaluates each condition in the order listed.\n","2. If a condition evaluates to true, it returns the corresponding result and exits the CASE statement.\n","3. If none of the conditions are true, it returns the default result specified in the ELSE clause, or NULL if no ELSE clause is provided.\n","\n","\n","\n","EXAMPLE : Suppose we have a table called Orders with columns order_id, product_name, and quantity. We want to create a new column order_status based on the quantity of each order:\n","\n","```\n","SELECT\n","    order_id,\n","    product_name,\n","    quantity,\n","    CASE\n","        WHEN quantity > 10 THEN 'High'\n","        WHEN quantity > 5 THEN 'Medium'\n","        ELSE 'Low'\n","    END AS order_status\n","FROM\n","    Orders;\n","```\n","\n","\n","\n","EXAMPLE : Suppose we have a table called Orders with columns order_id, order_date, and completed_date.
