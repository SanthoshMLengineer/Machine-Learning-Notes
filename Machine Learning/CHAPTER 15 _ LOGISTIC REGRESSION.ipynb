It is used for classification problem.\n","Example : Predicting whether patient has cancer or not.\n","\n","**Logistic Regression Assumptions:**\n","- Binary logistic regression requires the dependent variable to be binary.\n","- The independent variables should be independent of each other. That is, the model should have little or no multi-collinearity.\n","- The independent variables are linearly related to the log odds.\n","- Logistic regression requires quite large sample sizes.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","The basis for this algorithm is sigmoid function and it is also called logistic function. Sigmoid function will give output in between of 0 and 1 for any real valued number. Logistic regression model takes a linear equation as input and uses logistic function and log odds to perform a binary classification task.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","<center><img src=https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*fMhEmHqlieWQC1ryMl_mxg@2x.png width=\"400\"></center>\n","\n","This function will return values 0 to 1, and we need to set threshould value to classify into classes. Normally we set threshold to 0.5, if output of logistic function more than 0.5 classified into `1` class and if value is less than 0.5 classified into `0` class.\n","\n","**Types of Logistic Regression**\n","\n","1. <u>Binary Logistic Regression</u> :\n","The categorical response has only two 2 possible outcomes. Example: Spam or Not\n","2. <u>Multinomial Logistic Regression</u> :\n","Three or more categories without ordering. Example: Predicting which food is preferred more (Veg, Non-Veg, Vegan)\n","3. <u>Ordinal Logistic Regression</u> :\n","Three or more categories with ordering. Example: Movie rating from 1 to 5\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"rDZMRE4za5kO"}}]}
