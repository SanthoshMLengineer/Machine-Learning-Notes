Undersampling</u>**\n","\n","Undersampling is the process where you randomly delete some of the observations from the majority class in order to match the numbers with the minority class.\n","\n","The disadvantage of this is loosing information as we are deleting the observation. This may lead to underfitting because model will not generalise from data with less information.\n","\n","Example : Let us discuss credit card fraud detection.Their are 492 observation belongs to the fraud class that is minority class.
