Descriptive statistics summarizes the data where inferential statistics makes some conclusion about the population.\n","\n","**<h3><u>Hypothesis Testing</u></h3>**\n","\n","Hypothesis Testing is a statistical method, uses experimental data to make statistical decision on population. This test can be parametric or non-parametric. Parametric test follows normal distribution whereas no-parametric does not follow normal distribution.\n","\n","In this test, two hypotheses about a population are compared to see which is better supported by the sample data.\n","\n","\n","Hypothesis Testing is defined in two terms :\n","\n","1. Null Hypothesis\n","2. Alternative Hypothesis\n","\n","**<h4>1. Null Hypothesis</h4>**\n","\n","Null hypothesis is a hypothesis statement that there is no relationship between two measured phenomena, or no correlation among groups, in other words it is a basic assumption made based on domain or problem knowledge.\n","\n","**<h4>2. Alternative Hypothesis</h4>**\n","\n","In hypothesis testing alternative hypothesis is the hypothesis that is opposite to the null hypothesis.\n","\n","\n","**<u>Example</u>**\n","\n","  The average grade in the eighth grade is 40 out of 100.\n","The management of the school decided that extra lessons are necessary to improve the performance of the class.  The class earned an average of 45 points out of a potential 100 after taking supplemental classes. Can we be certain that the rise in grades is due to more lessons or is it simply random?\n","\n","<u>Null Hypothesis</u> : Average marks after extra class are same as that before the classes.\n","\n","<u>Alternative Hypothesis</u> : marks after extra class are significantly different from that before the class.\n","\n","\n","**Note**\n","\n","We cannot accept the Null hypothesis, only reject it or fail to reject it.\n","As a practical tip, Null hypothesis is generally kept which we want to disprove. For eg: You want to prove that students performed better after taking extra classes on their exam. The Null Hypothesis, in this case, would be that the marks obtained after the classes are same as before the classes.\n","\n","<u>Types of errors in hypothesis testing</u>\n","\n","1. **Type1 Error** : When we reject the null hypothesis, although that hypothesis was true. Type I error is denoted by alpha.\n","\n","2. **Type2 Error** :  When we accept the null hypothesis but it is false. Type II errors are denoted by beta.\n","\n","\n","**Let us understand on what basis we are going to accept or reject null hypothesis**\n","\n","**Level of significance** : We use 5% as fixed probability for level of significance.\n","\n","**P-value** : The P value is a probability that indicates how strongly the null hypothesis is supported by the sample data.\n","An higher p-value means that the collected data is more likely to support the null hypothesis. If p — value ≤ Significance Level, means that the sampled data provide enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis.\n","\n","\n","- If the p-value is below your threshold of significance (typically p < 0.05), you can reject the null hypothesis.\n","- A p-value higher than 0.05 (> 0.05) is not statistically significant and indicates that null hypothesis is strongly supported.You should note that you cannot accept the null hypothesis, we can only reject the null or fail to reject it.\n","\n","\n","**<h3>Steps for hypothesis testing</h3>**\n","\n","- State your null and alternate hypothesis\n","- Collect data\n","- Perform a statistical test\n","- Decide whether to reject or fail to reject your null hypothesis\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Different types of hypothesis test :\n","\n","- T Test ( Student T test)\n","- ANOVA Test\n","- Chi-Square Test\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"QFCFa4tJ7rQQ"}}]}
