Measure of Central Tendency</h3>**\n","\n","A basic and initial step is to explore your data is to get typical value which gives where most of the data is located. \n","\n","Methods to describe typical value for the feature :\n","\n","- Mean or Average\n","- Trimmed Mean\n","- Median\n","- Mode\n","\n","**Mean or Average**\n","\n","Mean is calculated by summing all the values divided by the total number of values, where total number of values is represented as `N (or n)`, `N` for population and `n` for sample.\n","-  Example : \n","\n","  ```\n","  Mean for 20, 30, 40 is \n","          \n","          = (20+30+40)/ total number of values\n","\n","          = (90)/3\n","\n","          = 30\n","  ```\n","\n","\n","**Trimmed Mean or Truncated mean**\n","\n","- Trimmed mean is same as mean, but it trims the outliers. You can specify how much percentage data you want to remove. \n","- For Example with a 5% trimmed mean, the lowest 5% and highest 5% of the data are excluded. The mean is calculated from the remaining 90% of data points.\n","\n","  ```\n","  Find the trimmed 20% mean for the following test scores: \n","          60, 81, 83, 91, 99.\n","\n","  Step 1: Trim the top and bottom 20% from the data. \n","          That leaves us with the middle three values:\u000b60, 81, 83, 91, 99.\n","\n","  Step 2: Find the mean with the remaining values. \n","          The mean is (81 + 83 + 91) / 3 ) = 85.\n","\n","  ```\n","\n","**Median**\n","\n","- Median is nothing but getting middle number of sorted data. N or n is used to represent total number of values. \n","```\n","If N(or n) is ODD then median is a value at position (N + 1)/2.\n","If N(or n) is even then we need to calculte value \n","        First_value is (N)/2 and value \n","        Second_value is (N + 1)/2 then \n","        median is (First_value + Second_value )/2. \n","```\n","\n","\n","**Mode**\n","\n","- Mode is a value which having highest frequency in a list of values. \n","\n","  ```\n","  Example : 2, 6, 7, 8, 8\n","  Mode value is 8 which having two occurrences.\n","  ```\n","\n","**<h3>2.
