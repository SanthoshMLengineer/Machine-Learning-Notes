Sample is a subset of population.\n","\n","We have to be more careful how we are selecting samples, these sampling methods helps to select the indivisuals or samples.\n","\n","Their are two types of samplinng methods :\n","1. Probability Sampling or Un-biased\n","2. Non-probability Sampling or biased sampling\n","\n","**<u>Probability Sampling</u>** :\n","\n","Probability Sampling is a sampling technique where selecting a individual from population randomly. Each individual from population having equal chance of getting selected.\n","\n","**<u>Non-Probability Sampling</u>** :      \n","\n","Non-Probability sampling is a sampling technique where selecting a individual from population is non-randomly. In this technique we are selectiong samples on some criteria.\n","\n","**<h3>Their are 4 types of probability sampling</h3>**\n","\n","1. Simple Random Sampling\n","2. Systematic Sampling\n","3. Stratified Sampling\n","4. Cluster Sampling\n","\n","\n","**<u><h4>Simple Random Sampling</h4></u>**\n","\n","Every element of the population has an equal probability of being chosen using this sampling technique.\n","\n","`Example : You need to gather the information about company X, so you have to select 100 employees from 1000 employees. Then you assign unique number 1-1000 to those employees. Use randomm generator to select 100 unique code.`\n","\n","**<u><h4>Systematic Random Sampling</h4></u>**\n","\n","In this sampling method every element in population is selected at regular interval.\n","\n","`Example : Every employee has a unique code you need to 100 employees, so take starting point as 5 and every 10th employee you select.`\n","\n","**<u><h4>Stratified Random Sampling</h4></u>**\n","\n","In this sampling method we will divide population into groups called strata dependending on relevent characters. And we are going to select element randomly in each strata.\n","\n","`Example : company has 600 womens and 400 mens and we need to select 100 members. Then we will divide into two strata based on gender. And we select 60 womens from 600 womens and 40 mens form 400 mens.`\n","\n","**<u><h4>Cluster Sampling</h4></u>**\n","\n","In this sampling method we will divide entire population into groups and each group has same characterstics, instead ofselecting members from each group we select randomly group itself.  \n","\n","`Example : Bank x has 10 branchs in various place, and we dont have time to travel every places then we randomly select 3 branchs.`\n","\n","\n","\n","**<h3>Their are 4 types of Non-probability sampling</h3>**\n","\n","1. Convenience Sampling\n","2. Voluntary response Sampling\n","3. Purposive Sampling\n","4. Snowball Sampling\n","\n","\n","**<u><h4>Convenience Sampling</h4></u>**\n","\n","In this sampling method we are going to select individuals who can accessible easily to the researcher.\n","\n","`\n","Example : If we want to gather information about college X then you select the students who knows you and gather all information. But this sampling will not give good results.\n","`\n","\n","**<u><h4>Voluntary response sampling</h4></u>**\n","\n","In this sampling method we are not contacting individuals to get the details, individual who are volunteer to give details are considered.\n","\n","`\n","Example : You give survey form to students, the students who wanted to give information they will write information in survey form and submit.\n","`\n","\n","**<u><h4>Judgement or Purposive Sampling</h4></u>**\n","\n","In this sampling method we are selecting individual who are more useful to the project.\n","\n","`\n","Example : If we want to gather information about study strategy of pass students. We select students who can give details of strategy.\n","`\n","\n","**<u><h4>Snowball Sampling</u></h4>**\n","\n","In this method we will select the individual who give information, and that individual will find another individual who will give information and so on.\n","\n","`\n","Example : You want to gather information of failed student in college X, so that you meet one person who agrees to participate in the research, and that person puts you in contact with other failed students.\n","`"],"metadata":{"id":"YOcZGyEbAEdm"}}]}
