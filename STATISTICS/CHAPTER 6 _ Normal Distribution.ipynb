Discrete Random Variable\n","2. Continuous Random Variable\n","    \n","**<u>1. Discrete Random Variable</u>**\n","\n","The random variables is a variable which stores distinct values.\n","\n","`For example: Consider a random variable X representing coin flip. All possible outcome of this experiments can be listed as {0,1}. In this case, the possible outcomes of the experiment are countable. Hence this is a discrete random variable.`\n","    \n","**<u>2.

But with most datasets, this is not the case. Generally, data points cluster on one side more than the other. These distributions are known as Skewed Distributions.\n","\n","\n","**1. Left Skewed Distribution**\n","\n","When data points cluster on the right side of the distribution, then the tail would be longer on the left side. This is the property of Left Skewed Distribution.

Histogram**\n","A histogram shows how data are distributed across a continuous range.\n","In a histogram, each bar corresponds to the tabulated frequency at each interval or bin.

Skewness**\n","Skewness is also another measure to check for normality which tells us the amount and direction of the skewed data points.\n","\n","Generally for the value of Skewness:\n","\n","- If the value is less than -0.5, we consider the distribution to be negatively skewed or left-skewed.\n","-  Whereas if the value is greater than 0.5, we consider the distribution to be positively skewed or right-skewed.\n","- And finally, if the value is between -0.5 and 0.5, we consider the distribution to be approximately symmetric\n","\n","\n","**3. kurtosis**\n","\n","Kurtosis refers to the degree of presence of outliers in the distribution. Kurtosis is a statistical measure, whether the data is heavy-tailed or light-tailed in a normal distribution.\n","  \n","Types of Kurtosis\n","- Leptokurtic or heavy-tailed distribution (kurtosis more than normal distribution , kurtosis > 3).\n","- Mesokurtic (kurtosis same as the normal distribution,  kurtosis is near to 3).\n","- Platykurtic or short-tailed distribution (kurtosis less than normal distribution, kurtosis < 3).\n","\n","<center><img src = \"https://editor.analyticsvidhya.com/uploads/57983kurt1.png\"></center>"]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.7.6"},"colab":{"provenance":[]}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
