Probability lies between 0 to 1. If Probability Value is near to 1 then there is high chances of getting event occured, if probability value is near to 0 then there is less chance of event occured. \n","\n","\n","Probability is calculted by :\n","\n","  <center><img src = \"https://cdn1.byjus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/formulas/2016/04/07181418/12.jpg\"></center>\n","\n","Some terminologies used in probability : \n","\n","1. Sample Space : Total number is events occured in an experiment. Suppose a rolling dice has six possible outcomes. Sample space : {1,2,3,4,5,6}. Also, an event is a subset of Sample Space.\n","\n","2. An Event : A subset of the sample space.\n","\n","3. Mutually Exclusive Event: When the occurrence of one event prevents the occurrence of other events, then it is said to be a mutually exclusive event.\n","\n","  P(AUB) = P(A) + P(B)\n","\n","\n","**<h3>Additive Rules of Probability</h3>**\n","\n","Additive rules state that the probability for getting A or B will be the sum of the probability of getting A and the probability of getting B. It is also denoted by ‘U’.\n","\n","- If two events are not effected by each other then P(A U B) = P(A) + P(B).\n","\n","- If two events are affected by each other, then P(A U B) = P(A) + P(B) — P(A ∩ B).\n","\n","\n","\n","**<h3>Multiplication Rules of Probability</h3>**\n","\n","When two events occur one after another here multiplication rules are used. It denotes by the ‘∩’ symbol.\n","\n","- Two events occur one after another, and both are independent, then the formula for this event is P(A ∩ B) = P(A)*P(B).\n","\n","- Two events occur one after another, and both are dependent on each other. Then we need to find the probability of occuring first event and find the probability of occuring both event. Then we need to multiply it.\n","\n","  P(R ∩ K) = P(R)*P(K/R)\n","\n","  We find a new term, P(K/R), called conditional probability. \n","\n","\n","\n","**<h3>Conditional Probability</h3>**\n","\n","Conditional probability is the probability of an event occurring provided another event has already occurred.\n","\n","<center><img src = \"https://cdn.kastatic.org/googleusercontent/7wjRBuY3NpLE_lQiypt1E2yIQBxqenT6L92UX22pn5hl5IRNAiRj97tLoWjzU2fJkbzJe_RtZ_kFu9g6gEa156Ov\" width = \"200px\"></center>\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"78HVZABohRou"}}]}
